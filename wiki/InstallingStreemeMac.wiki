#summary Web Server Installation on Apple Macs running OSX Version 6+
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This is the Mac/OSX install guide - if you're looking for other platform installation guides, please go back to the [InstallingStreemeStartPage start page of the installation]

Streeme requires the initial installation of a MAMP (Mac Apache MySQL PHP) web server package before the script can operate. Snow Leopard (OSX 6) has a built in Apache and PHP install, which is probably the easiest to get running - Mac Users, please contribute better ways to the project's team members, I'm still a bit fresh to OSX, but I was able to get a working environment using the plan below. One of my little worries about this is that it is controlled by apple, so future OSX major upgrades may mess with it

==Enabling PHP/Apache==

Go to System Preferences > Sharing and enable "Web Sharing"

on a commandline type:

{{{sudo cp /etc/php.ini.default /etc/php.ini}}}

you may want to chmod 666 your apache /etc/apache2/users/your_username.conf files and newly created  /etc/php.ini files so you can use them in a non UNIX editor.
 
==Installing MySQL==

Go to [http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/] and install the latest 

Copy the startup item to your startup as usual and install the app

{{{
sudo vi /Users/your_user_name/.bash_profile

add the following lines:
#inserting a path for mysql
export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH 
}}}
(escape :wq enter ) will write the file and quit VI

type:
{{{mysqladmin -u your_database_username password your_database_password}}}

copy:
{{{cp /usr/local/mysql/support-files/my-huge.cnf /etc/my.cnf}}}

link:
{{{ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock /var/mysql/mysql.sock}}}

chmod 666 on my.cnf while you're editing it unless you like VI or nano.


==Configuring the Server== 

Now you've got your bare bones server installed, you'll need to make some edits to the config files before you can proceed. 

===Apache Configs===
The above guide will add apache in compiled setup - no new functionality can be added to it, if you use macports or fink to build your copy of apache, you should include the following components:

 * add mod-rewrite    *required*
 * add mod-XSendFile  *optional*
 * add deflate_module *optional*

create the virtual hosts:
It's highly recommended that you choose two *random unused ports* between 1025-9800 and replace the example 8095/8096 pairs. One port is for the media stream and another is for HTML and program communication. Also make sure your paths are correct!

_/etc/apache2/httpd.conf_
{{{
# This is the configuration for the streeme app communication path
Listen *:8095

NameVirtualHost *:8095

<VirtualHost *:8095>
  DocumentRoot "d:/web/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  Alias /sf "d:/web/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf"
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

# This is the configuration for the music streamer
Listen *:8096

NameVirtualHost *:8096

<VirtualHost *:8096>
  DocumentRoot "d:/web/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

#Disable SVN directory sniffing through apache
<Directory ~ ".*\.svn"> 
Order allow,deny 
Deny from all 
Satisfy All 
</Directory> 
}}}

now validate you've made the correct changes by typing:

{{{/usr/sbin/apache2ctl configtest}}}

if all looks good, go ahead and restart apache, type:

{{{/usr/sbin/apache2ctl restart}}} 

===PHP Configs===

_/etc/php.ini_

 * set {{{magic_quotes_gpc = Off}}}
 * set {{{short_open_tag = Off}}}
 * set {{{memory_limit = 128M}}} or higher
 * set {{{pdo_mysql.default_socket=/tmp/mysql.sock}}}  

Use the pear package manager to install apc and http_download
 * {{{sudo pear install APC}}}
 * {{{sudo pear install HTTP_Download}}}

PHP MUST BE PART OF YOUR PATH! You'll know it's working if you type php on the command line and something starts happening rather than nothing happening :) 

===MySQL Configs===

You will have already set up your MySQL installation previous steps, but there's a couple of easy performance and internationalization tweaks to perform.

_/etc/my.cnf_
{{{
[mysqld]
default-character-set = utf8
default-collation = utf8_unicode_ci
query_cache_type = 1
query_cache_size  = 32M
}}}

===FFMPEG===
[http://www.macports.org/install.php Install Macports]

restart your shell 

type 
{{{
sudo port -v selfupdate
sudo port install ffmpeg +gpl +lame +faac +libogg
}}}


===Cleaning Up===

Restart both apache and mysql before you continue:
chmod all of your config files back to 644
 
 * {{{sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM restart}}} 
 * {{{sudo /usr/sbin/apache2ctl restart}}}
