Before you fire up Streeme for the first time, you'll need to add user accounts. Set up an account per device you'd like to use with Streeme.  

= Adding an Account =
To add an account, type:
<br/>
{{{./symfony guard:create-user your_username your_password}}}
<br/>

= Changing your Password =
To change your password, type:
<br/>
{{{./symfony guard:change-password your_username your_new_password}}}
<br/>

= It's Time to Make Some Noise! = 
Now you've got an account, you can launch Streeme by opening Chrome or Safari and typing 
in your_ip_address:your_port/
eg http://127.0.0.1:8095

The login screen will come up, just enter your username and password and you're IN!
